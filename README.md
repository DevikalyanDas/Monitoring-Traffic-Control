# Monitoring-Traffic-Control
This is the project for course Data Science 2021 at Saarland University. The goal of this project is to estimate traffic density of the real-time images captured from smartphones using deep learning approach. Also, we deployed the models in an android application TrafficMode, which will immediately capture the images and apply the trained models for inference. But for this we created an extensive dataset with various levels of traffic density.
